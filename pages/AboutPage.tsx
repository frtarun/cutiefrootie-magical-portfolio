            Hey, Iâ€™m <span className="font-bold text-pink-500">cutiefrootie</span> ðŸ‘‹, a developer who loves creating little pockets of happiness on the web.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-slate-600">
            I started this journey with a simple belief: websites don't have to be boring. They can be magical, playful, and deeply personal. I was tired of the same corporate templates and wanted to build things that sparked genuine joy. So, I began creating these small, interactive sites for friends' birthdays and anniversaries, and their smiles told me I was onto something special.

              <li>My code is powered by coffee and cute animal videos.</li>
              <li>My goal is to fight web-boringness, one magical site at a time!</li>

            This is my entire philosophy. In a digital world that can often feel cold and impersonal, I want to create things that foster connection and celebrate life's small, beautiful moments. A personalized website for a birthday or an anniversary isn't just code; it's a heartfelt gift, a digital keepsake that shows someone you care. Itâ€™s about using technology to amplify joy and strengthen human bonds.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-slate-600">
            Every project you see here is a step towards that mission. I hope they bring a smile to your face, too.
